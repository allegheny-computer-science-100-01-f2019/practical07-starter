# cs100f2019-practical07-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the solution materials for Practical 7 in Computer Science 100.

Since the Travis builds for this repository will initially fail (as evidenced by
a red &#x2717; appearing in the commit logs instead of a green &#x2714;), the
programmer is responsible for completing all of the steps needed to satisfy the
requirements for the assignment, thus causing a &#x2714; to instead appear in
the commit logs.

## Introduction
In this practical students are invited to learn about the ethical and social impact of computer science, to explore ideas around ethical training of computer scientists, and to investigate various code of ethics in the field of computing and their implications. Participating in team discussions and broader class discussions, each team is required answer the (what, why and how) questions related to ethics and computer science found in the reflection Markdown document.

## Using Travis CI

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)  every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The checking
will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment &mdash; thus creating your own
private repository &mdash; and the course instructor and/or GitHub enables Travis for
it. If you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize
Travis CI to access the private repositories that you created on GitHub. If you
do not see either a yellow &#9679; or a green &#x2714; or a red &#x2717; in your
listing of commits, then please ask the instructor to see whether or not
Travis CI was correctly enabled.

## Reporting Problems

If you have found a problem with this assignment's provided source code or
documentation, then you can go to the [Java Assignment Starter
100-01](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-100-01-f2019/practical07-starter)
repository and [raise an
issue](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-100-01-f2019/practical07-starter/issues).
If you have found a problem with the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) and the way that it checks
your assignment, then you can also [raise an
issue](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader/issues) in that repository.
To ensure that your issue is properly resolved, please provide as many details
as is possible about the problem that you experienced. If you discover a problem
with the assignment sheet for this project, then please raise an issue in the
GitHub repository that provides the assignment sheets for your course.

Whenever possible, individuals who find, and use the appropriate GitHub issue
tracker to correctly document, a mistake in any aspect of this assignment will
receive free [GitHub stickers](https://octodex.github.com/) and extra credit
towards their grade for the project.
