# cs100s2019-practical06-solution

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the solution materials for Practical 6 in Computer Science 100.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Since the Travis builds for this repository will initially fail (as evidenced by
a red &#x2717; appearing in the commit logs instead of a green &#x2714;), the
programmer is responsible for completing all of the steps needed to satisfy the
requirements for the assignment, thus causing a &#x2714; to instead appear in
the commit logs.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to implement and test a Java program,
called `PasswordChecker`, that will produce textual output after reading in
a password from a file and then performing some diagnostic tests for this
password. Please see the comments in the source code and the laboratory
assignment sheet for more details. As verified by
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle), the source code for the
`PasswordChecker.java` files must adhere to all of the requirements in the 
[Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

The source code in the `PasswordChecker` file must also pass additional tests
set by the [GatorGrader tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
Specifically, GatorGrader will check the following characteristics of your
implementation:

* The `PasswordChecker` program must:
  * Contain at least ten single-line comments and two multi-line comments
  * Contain `while` and `if/else` statements
  * Uses `Scanner` class to read the user's input from the terminal
  * Utilize `int` and `boolean` data types
  * Call the `println` method at least ten times to produce the desired output

When you use the `git commit` command to transfer your source code to your
GitHub repository, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) will initialize a build
of your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both
your source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you
will see a green &#x2714; in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your
submission does not meet the requirements, a red &#x2717; will appear instead.
The instructor will reduce a programmer's grade for this assignment if the red
&#x2717; appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of
laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides.

To do well on this assignment, you should also review Chapters 1 through 4.
Finally, please read Sections 5.1 through 5.3 to learn more about conditional
logic constructs. Please see the course instructor or one of the
teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading
assignments.

## System Commands

This project invites students to enter system commands into a terminal window.
This assignment uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to deliver programs, such
as `gradle` and the source code and packages needed to run
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader), to a students'
computer, thereby eliminating the need for a programmer to install them on their
development workstation. Individuals who do not want or can not install Docker can
optionally install of the programs mentioned in the [Project
Requirements](#requirements) section of this document. Once all the required
programs are installed locally on a machine, a software developer can type the
various `gradle` commands directly in the terminal.

### Using Docker

Once you have installed [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), you can use the
following `docker run` command to start `gradle grade` as a containerized
application, using the [DockaGator](https://github.com/GatorEducator/dockagator)
Docker image available on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/gatoreducator/repository/docker/gatoreducator/dockagator).

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

The aforementioned command will use `"$(pwd)"` (i.e., the current directory) as
the project directory and `"$HOME/.dockagator"` as the cached GatorGrader
directory. Please note that both of these directories must exist, although only
the project directory must contain something. Generally, the project directory
should contain the source code and technical writing of this assignment, as
provided to a student through GitHub. Additionally, the cache directory should
not contain anything other than directories and programs created by DockaGator,
thus ensuring that they are not otherwise overwritten during the completion of
the assignment. To ensure that the previous command will work correctly, you
should create the cache directory by running the command `mkdir
$HOME/.dockagator`. If the above `docker run` command does not work correctly on
the Windows operating system, you may need to instead run the following command
to work around limitations in the terminal window:

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd):/project" \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

Since the above `docker run` command uses a Docker images that, by default, runs
`gradle grade` and then exits the Docker container, you may want to instead run
the following command so that you enter an "interactive terminal" that will
allow you to repeatedly run commands within the Docker container.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Once you have typed this command, you can use the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) in the Docker container by
typing the command `gradle grade` in your terminal. Running this command will
produce a lot of output that you should carefully inspect. If GatorGrader's
output shows that there are no mistakes in the assignment, then your source code
and writing are passing all of the automated baseline checks. However, if the
output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to understand what
they are and then try to fix them.

Here are some additional commands that you may need to run when using Docker:

* `docker info`: display information about how Docker runs on your workstation
* `docker images`: show the Docker images installed on your workstation
* `docker container list`: list the active images running on your workstation
* `docker system prune`: remove many types of "dangling" components from your workstation
* `docker image prune`: remove all "dangling" docker images from your workstation
* `docker container prune`: remove all stopped docker containers from your workstation
* `docker rmi $(docker images -q) --force`: remove all docker images from your workstation

### Using Gradle

You can complete several important Java programming tasks by using the
`gradle` tool. For instance, you can compile (i.e., create bytecode from the
program's source code if it is correct) the program using the command `gradle
build`. Running the command `gradle -q --console plain run` will suppress the display of
Gradle's diagnostic information and only produce output of the program.
Here are some other commands that you can type:

* `gradle grade`: run the [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) tool to check your work
* `gradle clean`: clean the project of all the derived files
* `gradle check`: check the quality of the code using Checkstyle
* `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
* `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line
* `gradle tasks`: display details about the Gradle system

To run one of these commands, you must be in the main (i.e., "home base")
directory for this assignment where the `build.gradle` file is located.

## Expected Program Output

Your program should adhere to all of the requirements for the assignment and
pass all of the verification checks, and also produce textual output like the
following:

## Using Travis CI

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) and additional
checking programs every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The checking
will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment &mdash; thus creating your own
private repository &mdash; and the course instructor and/or GitHub enables Travis for
it. If you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize
Travis CI to access the private repositories that you created on GitHub. If you
do not see either a yellow &#9679; or a green &#x2714; or a red &#x2717; in your
listing of commits, then please ask the instructor to see whether or not
Travis CI was correctly enabled.
